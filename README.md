# Snake
This is a basic version of the classic game of snake designed in Java. It runs in a simple designed GUI that allows for the user to play the game as well as keep track of the current score. 
After the player loses, they will be directed to a "play again?" screen as well have the option to press a simple restart button. Not only that, but through the console, the
player can play background music to add to the experience. This was my first real dive into game development using a language that I was familar with Java and was a fun expereince.
